# Codebook for run_analysis.R

The variables in the merged data set are described as follows:

1. volunteer - the ID of the subject volunteers. It is from 1-30 .
2. activity_name - the descriptive names of the activities. They are: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing and laying.

The next set of variables on the merged data set refers to the subject volunteer's movements as measured by an accelerometer and gyroscope. Only the mean and standard deviation measurements were extracted from the movement (feature) variables. The first letter (t of f) refers to time or frequency.

 - tAcc - from accelerometer
 - tGyro - from gyroscope
 - tBodyAcc - body's movement measured by accelerometer
 - tBodyGyro - body's movement measured by gyroscope
 - fBodyAcc - Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) frequency measurement by accelerometer
 - fBodyGyro - Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) frequency measurement by gyroscope

The variables in the merged data set are described as follows:

1. volunteer - the ID of the subject volunteers. It is from 1-30 .
2. activity_name - the descriptive names of the activities. They are walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing and laying.

The next set of variables on the tidy data set refer to the subject volunteer's movements. Only the mean and standard deviation measurements were extracted from the movement (feature) variables of the gyroscope.
